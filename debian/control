# The project needs a c++11 compiler.
# Its known to work with g++ 4.6 and up
#
# FIXME if there's a better, cleaner way to express
# "This project needs a c++11 compiler" then specify it here
# This probably is not an issue until Debian switches away from
# the GNU Compiler collection...
#
# Rest of deps:
# - debhelper 7.3.0
# A Debhelper with cmake support
# (otherwise it will not see the CMakeLists.txt and just build
# a package with a manpage...
#
# - libpoppler-qt4-dev
# the poppler-library for PDF decoding
#
# - hardening-wrapper
# And the hardening-wrapper because lintian told me to make the build
# safer.
#
# - lsb-release
# This is needed for the switch in the debian/rules file checking
# against lucid

Description: Dual-Screen PDF Viewer for LaTeX-beamer
 This is a specialized PDF Viewing application custom-made for
 the LaTeX class beamer, specifically the
 "show notes on second screen=right" option.
 .
 To make use of this program, you will need a document created
 by latex-beamer, and you will need two monitors connected to
 your computer.
 They do not need to have the same resolution, not even the same
 aspect ratio.
 .
 This program will split your PDF page in half, and display the
 left half (intended for the audience) on one monitor (think:
 a notebook's VGA output connected to your university's projector)
 and it will display the right half (intended for you) on the
 second screen.
 Also, on the second screen, you get page thumbnails and status
 information, like the time since you started the presentation
 and a "wall clock".
